name: cilium or flagellum-dependent cell motility
namespace: biological_process
def: "Cell motility due to movement of eukaryotic cilia or bacterial-type flagella or archaeal-type flagella." [GOC:cilia, GOC:hjd, GOC:krc]
comment: Note that we deem eukaryotic cilia and microtubule-based flagella to be equivalent, while the bacterial- and archaeal-type flagella have a different structure. The former are microtubule-based structures that lash back and forth and are present only in eukaryotes, while the latter achieve motility by rotation. Bacterial- and archaeal-type flagella are superficially similar but have a different molecular composition and fine structure. These three structures never co-exist in the same organism. Therefore, GO:0001539 'cilium or flagellum-dependent cell motility' is in the subset of terms that should not be used for direct gene product annotation. Instead, select a child term. Direct annotations to GO:0001539 'cilium or flagellum-dependent cell motility' may be amended during annotation QC.

Anatomical structures can be macroscopic such as a carpel, or microscopic such as an acrosome." [GOC:dph, GOC:jid, GOC:tb]
comment: Note that, for example, the formation of a pseudopod in an amoeba would not be considered formation involved in morphogenesis because it would not be thought of as the formation of an anatomical structure that was part of the shaping of the amoeba during its development. The formation of an axon from a neuron would be considered the formation of an anatomical structure involved in morphogenesis because it contributes to the creation of the form of the neuron in a developmental sense.

comment: Example: [ E=wing Q=absent ] -applies to an organism that lacks wings. Note that this is the reciprocal quality to the relational quality "lacks all parts of type". This means that [E=wing Q=absent] is replaceable with [E=organism Q=lacks_all_parts_of_type E2=Wing]. The latter is preferable as it allows greater precision in stating what is lacking from where. E.g. We can say [E=spermatocyte Q=lacks_all_parts_of_type E2=aster] to describe spermatocytes that have no asters.

comment: Relational qualities are qualities that hold between multiple entities. Normal (monadic) qualities such as the shape of a eyeball exist purely as a quality of that eyeball. A relational quality such as sensitivity to light is a quality of that eyeball (and connecting nervous system) as it relates to incoming light waves/particles.

comment: We use the has_part relation to relate complex qualities to more primitive ones. A complex quality is a collection of qualities. The complex quality cannot exist without the sub-qualities. For example, the quality 'swollen' necessarily comes with the qualities of 'protruding' and 'increased size'.

comment: There are frequently two ways to state the same thing: we can say 'spermatocyte lacks asters' or 'asters absent from spermatocyte'. In this case the quality is 'lacking all parts of type' - it is a (relational) quality of the spermatocyte, and it is with respect to instances of 'aster'. One of the popular requirements of PATO is that it continue to support 'absent', so we need to relate statements which use this quality to the 'lacking all parts of type' quality.

comment: PATO divides qualities between normal (monadic, singly-occurring) qualities and relational qualities. Relational qualities stand in the 'towards' relation with respect to some additional entity. For example, The sensitivity of an eye towards red light. In some cases we want to represent a quality such as 'protruding' in both monadic and relational branches. We use this relation to link them.
