This repository contains the ontology files for the Ontology of Microbial Phenotypes (OMP). 

The master branch contains the following files:
     - archived_files - Do not use these files. They exist only for archival reasons.
     - omp-edit.obo - Editors' version of OMP. This is a working copy and should not be considered stable.
     - most recent stable releases of the ontology:
          omp-simple.obo - The file 'omp-simple.obo' contains only OMP terms
          omp.obo - The file 'omp.obo' includes both OMP terms, terms from external ontologies, and logical definitions. 
          omp.owl - The file 'omp.owl' 
     - other files - The deprecated file 'microbial_observable_ontology' (r23) was previously removed.
     
Previous releases of OMP can be accessed from the tags branch.
