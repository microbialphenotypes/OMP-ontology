comment: This term was obsoleted in response to our decision to not have precomposed terms for individual antimicrobial compounds.  Instead, when possible, terms will be made for structural classes of antimicrobial compounds, for example 'resistant to beta-lactam', and the particular antimicrobial compound tested will be annotated by putting its CHEBI ID into the annotation extension column. In cases where a natural grouping doesn't exist, the user should use "OMP:0007876 resistant to an antimicrobial agent" and put the CHEBI ID (or other identifier) into the annotation extension column.

comment: This is a high-level term whose primary purpose is to organize terms beneath it in the ontology, and we expect that it will not be used for direct annotations. Please consider using a more specific term to annotate each phenotype.\n\nDepending on the assay used, a change in measured mating efficiency may reflect a change in conjugation frequency (see OMP:0007412 mating phenotype and its descendants) and/or a change in some other biological process such as sexual sporulation (see OMP:0007045 and its descendants). For this reason mating efficiency phenotype is not a child of mating phenotype, but instead a child of sexual reproduction phenotype (OMP:0007406).

Other terms in this branch were redefined, but this term was made obsolete and replaced by OMP:0007250 ! increased resistance to a chemical.\n\nWhen using OMP:0007250 for annotations enter the database identifier for the specific chemical in the Annotation Extension field.

comment: This is a high-level term whose primary purpose is to organize terms beneath it in the ontology, and we expect that it will not be used for direct annotations. Please consider using a more specific term to annotate each phenotype.\n\nTolerance applies only to microbiocidal antimicrobial agents and not to microbiostatic agents. This is in contrast to resistance which applies to both microbiocidal and microbiostatic agents.

comment: There are frequently two ways to state the same thing: we can say 'spermatocyte lacks asters' or 'asters absent from spermatocyte'. In this case the quality is 'lacking all parts of type' - it is a (relational) quality of the spermatocyte, and it is with respect to instances of 'aster'. One of the popular requirements of PATO is that it continue to support 'absent', so we need to relate statements which use this quality to the 'lacking all parts of type' quality.

comment: PATO divides qualities between normal (monadic, singly-occurring) qualities and relational qualities. Relational qualities stand in the 'towards' relation with respect to some additional entity. For example, The sensitivity of an eye towards red light. In some cases we want to represent a quality such as 'protruding' in both monadic and relational branches. We use this relation to link them.
