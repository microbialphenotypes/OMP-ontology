comment: There are frequently two ways to state the same thing: we can say 'spermatocyte lacks asters' or 'asters absent from spermatocyte'. In this case the quality is 'lacking all parts of type' - it is a (relational) quality of the spermatocyte, and it is with respect to instances of 'aster'. One of the popular requirements of PATO is that it continue to support 'absent', so we need to relate statements which use this quality to the 'lacking all parts of type' quality.

comment: PATO divides qualities between normal (monadic, singly-occurring) qualities and relational qualities. Relational qualities stand in the 'towards' relation with respect to some additional entity. For example, The sensitivity of an eye towards red light. In some cases we want to represent a quality such as 'protruding' in both monadic and relational branches. We use this relation to link them.
